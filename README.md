# FMML-Parser
Codes for my undergrad thesis :)

This project is a vulnerable parser for a custom made markup language named Fuzz Me Markup Language (FMML).
If you're reading this the repo is still probably lacking some organization, eventually I plan to split this into folders and instructions on how to use.


I plan to eventually upload all the specification of FMML here, just need to translate to english first.

If you speak portuguese, you might be happy with the thesis itself, I'll be publishing it here as well when I receive my grade.
